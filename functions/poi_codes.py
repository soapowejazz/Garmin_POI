# COURSE POINTS CODING
# Here is the coding used for the course points, structured as a list
# the first column of the list contains all the possible keywords that are associated with a specific category of course points
# the second column contains the code of that particular course point, so that the icon on the Garmin is the appropriate one
# you can add as many keywords as you want for each category
